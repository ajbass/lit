Description: Identifying latent genetic interactions in genome-wide association studies
    using the Latent Interaction Testing (LIT) framework.
    LIT is a flexible kernel-based approach that leverages information across
    multiple traits to detect latent genetic interactions without specifying or
    observing the interacting variable (e.g., environment). LIT is also 
    computationally scalable for biobank-scale datasets.
